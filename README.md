# Computer Network Design

This repository contains a network simulation project designed using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It was created as part of the Computer Networks course requirements.

## 📌 Project Overview
The project demonstrates a functional network topology including routers, switches, and end devices. The main objective is to design a scalable network, configure the devices correctly, and establish end-to-end connectivity between different local area networks (LANs).

## 🛠 Configurations & Features
The following network concepts and configurations are implemented in this project:

* **Network Topology Design:** Logical placement and cabling of network devices.
* **IPv4 Addressing:** Proper IP configuration and subnetting for devices.
* **Router Configuration:** Interface settings and routing setup to enable communication between networks.
* **Switch Configuration:** Basic switching operations for local network connectivity.
* **Connectivity Verification:** Successful communication tests between end devices using Ping and Traceroute utilities.
